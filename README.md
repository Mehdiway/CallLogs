Installation
-------------

 **Step 1**. Add the JitPack repository to your root build.gradle file.
 

    allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
		}
	}

**Step 2**. Add the library dependency to your app build.gradle file

    dependencies {
	        compile 'com.github.wickerlabs:CallLogs:1.06'
	}
	
**Step 3**. Handle permissions (For API 23+)
> For those using targeting API 23+, you should handle the runtime permissions for READ_CONTACTS and READ_CALL_LOG. As a reference check  out the sample app in the repository. Other than that, permissions are automatically added to the manifest file.

Usage
-------------

 - Initialization

	```java
     	LogsManager logsManager = new LogsManager(context);
	```

 
 - Getting a list of call logs
 
	```java
     	List<LogObject> callLogs = logsManager.getLogs(type);
	```

  
  >  Available list types :
  >  
  >  ***LogsManager.INCOMING_CALLS***: for getting the list (LogObject) of all the incoming calls.
  >  
  >  ***LogsManager.OUTGOING_CALLS***: for getting the list (LogObject) of all the incoming calls.
  >  
  >  ***LogsManager.MISSED_CALLS***: for getting the list (LogObject) of all the incoming calls.
  >  
  >  ***LogsManager.ALL_CALLS***: for getting the list (LogObject) of all the calls.
 
 - Getting call durations
 
 `logsManager.getIncomingDuration()`: returns the number of seconds for all the incoming calls made.
 
 `logsManager.getOutgoingDuration()`: returns the number of seconds for all the outgoing calls made.

  `logsManager.getTotalDuration()`: returns the number of seconds for all the calls made.

 `logsManager.getCoolDuration(type)`: returns a String in the form of  "***x* hrs *xx* mins**" or "***xx* mins *xx* secs**"
 
 >  Available duration types :
>  
>  ***LogsManager.INCOMING***: for getting duration for all the incoming calls.
>  
>  ***LogsManager.OUTGOING***: for getting duration for all the incoming calls.
>  
>    ***LogsManager.TOTAL***: for getting duration for all the calls.

Using LogObjects
--------------------
- Initialization
> 	```java 
	LogObject logObject = new LogObject(context);
	```

- Some useful methods
 
 `logObject.getDuration()`: returns an `int`  of the seconds used for that particular call.
 
 `logObject.getNumber()`: returns a `String` of the number associated with the call made.

 `logObject.getContactName()`: returns a `String` of the contact name for the number in the log, if not found, it returns the number.

  `logObject.getType()`: returns an `int` for the type of the call log.

 `logObject.getCoolDuration()`: returns a `String` in the form of  "***x* hrs *xx* mins**" or "***xx* mins *xx* secs**" based on the duration.

Examples
--------
Retriving a list of all call logs:

	```java
   	ListView logList = (ListView) findViewById(R.id.LogsList);

    	LogsManager logsManager = new LogsManager(this);

    	List<LogObject> callLogs = logsManager.getLogs(LogsManager.ALL_CALLS);

    	LogsAdapter logsAdapter = new LogsAdapter(this, R.layout.log_layout, callLogs);

    	logList.setAdapter(logsAdapter);
	```
